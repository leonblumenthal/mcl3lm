# Monocular Camera Localization in 3D LiDAR Maps
This is an implementation of the paper "Monocular Camera Localization in 3D LiDAR Maps" [1] using C++ and Python. 


It was my final project for the practical course [Vision-based Navigation](https://vision.in.tum.de/teaching/ws2022/visnav_ws2022) by the Computer Vision Group at Technical University of Munich.
